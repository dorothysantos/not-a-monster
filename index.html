        Hello! Welcome to the lyric game (also known as a game poem) “You are not a Monster.” Please be aware that this game is dedicated to and for caregivers. It is not intended as an experience to roleplay as a caregiver, and it does not include any direction, suggestions, or instructions on how to provide care. These prompts are meant to be read in a contemplative manner and enacted as you see fit. Please touch this card to proceed.
